	abstract = {How do you make sense of a graph that you have never seen before? Building on recent work demonstrating that prior knowledge of conventional graph types is extraordinarily difficult to overcome, we explore the use of implicit scaffolding to reconstruct graph reading as an insight problem. We hypothesize that constructing a mental impasse will improve learner performance by increasing the probability learners will reconsider their default interpretation strategies and recognize alternative interpretations of novel graphical forms. In a between-subjects laboratory experiment we find support for this hypothesis. Analysis of qualitative data suggests promising directions for understanding graphical intuitions, and we conclude with suggestions for future work that address the timing of mental model formation for unconventional graphic forms.},

	abstract = {Can the representation of event sequence influence how jurors remember and reason in a legal case? We addressed this ques-tion by examining the interaction between an individual's pre-ferred spatial construal of time (SCT) for an external (visual-spatial) representation and the SCT of a courtroom graphic. One hundred fifty three undergraduates played the role of ju-rors in a fictitious civil trial. The details of a case were re-counted in a multimedia presentation featuring timelines an-imated in one of four orientations: left-right, right-left, top-bottom, and bottom-top. Participants were assessed on mea-sures of comprehension and causal reasoning. Results indi-cated effects of timeline orientation and SCT choice behav-ior on comprehension and reasoning. We discuss these results in terms of the role of attention in temporal-causal reasoning, and implications for the design of multimedia materials for the courtroom.},

	abstract = {The historical moment when a person worked in front of a single computer has passed. Computers are now ubiquitous and embedded in virtually every new device and system, connecting our personal and professional activities to ever-expanding information resources with previously unimaginable computational power. Yet with all the increases in capacity, speed, and connectivity, our experiences too often remain difficult, awkward, and frustrating. Even after six decades of design evolution there is little of the naturalness and contextual sensitivity required for convivial interaction with computer-mediated information. We envision a future in which the existing world of documents and applications is linked to a multiscale personalized information space in which dynamic visual entities behave in accordance with cognitively motivated rules sensitive to tasks, personal and group interaction histories, and context. The heart of the project is to rethink the nature of computer-mediated information as a basis to begin to fully realize the potential of computers to assist information-based activities. This requires challenging fundamental presuppositions that have led to today’s walled gardens and information silos. Our goal is to catalyze an international research community to rethink the nature of information as a basis for radically advancing the human-centered design of information-based work and helping to ensure the future is one of convivial, effective, and humane systems. In this paper, we propose a new view of information systems, discuss cognitive requirements for a human-centered information space, and sketch a research agenda and approach.},

The present investigation addresses this question by examining the interaction between an individual's preferred spatial construal of time (SCT) for a representational task and the SCT of a stimulus. One hundred fifty three undergraduates played the role of jurors in a fictitious civil litigation.

Results indicated effects of timeline orientation and SCT choice behavior on comprehension and reasoning.

Building on research demonstrating that prior knowledge of graphical conventions is difficult to overcome, we reconstrue graph reading as an insight problem. We hypothesize that imposing a mental impasse during a particular type of graph reading task will improve comprehension by inducing a sense of puzzlement, prompting learners to reconsider their interpretation. We find support for this proposal in a betweensubjects experiment in which participants presented with an impasse-formulated version of graph reading questions are significantly more likely to correctly interpret a graph featuring an unconventional coordinate system. We characterize the differential patterns of mouse movements for learners between conditions and discuss implications for the use of novel graphical forms in science communication.},

After observing students reading a deceptively simple graph for time intervals, we designed four instructional scaffolds for evaluation. In a laboratory study, we found that only one scaffold (an interactive image) supported accurate interpretation for most students. Subsequent analysis of differences between two sets of materials revealed that task structure–specifically the extent to which a problem poses a mental impasse–may function as a powerful aid for comprehension. We find that prior knowledge of conventional graph types is extraordinarily difficult to overcome.},

	abstract = {“A picture is worth 1000 words,” the adage goes, but only—I argue—if you know how to read it. The same is true of graphs, charts, and diagrams. As powerful as these visuospatial tools may be in their communicative efficiency, they needn’t be immediately easy to understand. In fact, there are often trade-offs between a graph’s discoverability and efficiency. Even for informationally equivalent forms, the computational efficiency of a less conventional representation may outweigh concerns over ease of use for the untrained reader. It is this fact that underlies much innovation in Information Visualization, and the development of sophisticated interfaces for highly skilled workers performing specialized tasks. Sometimes this work results in novel, unconventional representations computationally suited to particular complex tasks, but that would present a challenge to the lay reader. Meanwhile, most work in remediating errors in graph comprehension has focused on “second order” readings: characterizing the trends or relationships between data represented in a graph. The ability to make these readings allows us to use graphs as vehicles for learning concepts—especially in science. We tend to accept a priori that well-designed graphs readily afford first-order readings: operations for extracting data from a graph. Accordingly, we know more about learning with representations, than we do about the learning of representations.In this dissertation, I use simple graphs with an unconventional coordinate system to explore how readers extract information from a graph when they lack knowledge of its graphical formalism. I address what the systematic errors readers make can tell us about our graphical intuitions, and the interaction of perceptual and conceptual processing that underlies graph comprehension.},
